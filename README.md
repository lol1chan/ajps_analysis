# ajps_analysis
In this repository, you will find Python implementations of the AJPS-1, AJPS-2, and AJPS-KEM cryptosystems. These are based on modular arithmetic over Mersenne numbers M_n = 2^n - 1, and include extensions that utilize Crandall numbers M_{n,c} = 2^n - c and generalized Mersenne numbers M_{n,m} = 2^n - 2^m - 1 as alternative moduli.

The repository also contains modified versions of all AJPS cryptosystems adapted for these alternative modular bases, allowing for broader cryptographic exploration and performance tuning.
